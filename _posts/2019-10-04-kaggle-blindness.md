# Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Challenge   

***Top 3% (76/2943) solution write-up** for the [Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection). Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened. Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults*

This repository consists of code and configs that were used to train our best single model. The solution is powered by awesome [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) library.


### Data

*Input Data*

2015 competition data was used for pretraining all our models. Without it out models performed much worse. We used different techniques: first train on old data, then finetuning on the new train, another technique train on both data, the finetune on new train data. Besides, starting finetuning with freezing all layers and training only last FC layer gave us more stable results.

### Models and Preprocessing

From the beginning, efficientnet outperformed other models. Using fp16 (available in kaggle kernels) allowed to use bigger batch size - speeded up training and inference.

Models used in the final submission:

1. EfficientNet-B5 (best single model): 224x224 (tta with Hflip, preprocessing - crop_from_gray, circle_crop, ben_preprocess=10)
2. EfficientNet-B4: 256x256 (tta with Hflip, preprocessing - crop_from_gray, circle_crop, ben_preprocess=20)
3. EfficientNet-B5: 256x256 (tta with Hflip, preprocessing - crop_from_gray, circle_crop, ben_preprocess=30)
4. EfficientNet-B5: (256x256) without specific preprocess, two models with different augmentations.

We tried bigger image sizes but it gave worse results. EfficientNet-B2 and EfficientNet-B6 gave worse results as well.

### Augmentations
From [Albumentations](https://github.com/albu/albumentations) library:
Hflip, VFlip,  RandomScale, CenterCrop,  RandomBrightnessContrast, ShiftScaleRotate, RandomGamma, RandomGamma, JpegCompression, HueSaturationValue, RGBShift, ChannelShuffle, ToGray, Cutout

### Training
First 3 models were trained using [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) library and the last one with FastAi, both of them work on top of Pytorch.

We used both ordinal regression and regression. Models with classification tasks weren't well enough to use them.
Adam with OneCycle was used for training. WarmUp helped to get more stable results. RAdam, Label smoothing didn't help to improve the score.

We tried to use leak investigated [here](https://www.kaggle.com/miklgr500/leakage-detection-about-8-test-dataset) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb/adversarial-validation-quick-fast-ai-approach) by fixing output results. Almost 10% of the public test data were part of the train. Results dropped significantly, which means training data annotation were pretty bad.

We tried kappa coefficient optimization, it didn't give reliable improvement on public, but could help us on private almost +0.003 score.

### Hardware
We used 1x*2080, 1x* Tesla v40, 1x*1070ti
